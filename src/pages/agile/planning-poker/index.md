## Planning Poker
### Introduction
Planning poker is an estimation and planning technique in the Agile development model. It is used to estimate the development effort  required for a [user story](../user-stories/index.md) or a feature. 

### Process
The planning poker is done for one user story at a time.

Each estimator holds poker cards with various values. The unit used for the values can be the number of days, story points, or any other kind of estimation unit agreed on by the team.

The team discusses the story, asking any clarifying questions that they might have. 

At the end of the discussion, each person first selects a card without showing it to the others. Then, they reveal their cards at the same time.

If all the cards have the same value, the value becomes the estimate for the story. If there are differences, the team discusses the reasons for the values that they have chosen.

After this discussion, the process of picking a card in private and then revealing it at the same time is repeated. This is done until there is a consensus on the estimate.
